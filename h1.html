                <p>Istanbul is a significant Turkish metropolis that spans the Bosphorus Strait, connecting Europe and Asia. The cultural influence of various empires that formerly governed here can be seen in the Old City. The Roman-era Hippodrome in Sultan
                    Ahmed's open-air neighbourhood has hosted chariot races for centuries, and the Egyptian obelisk still stands. The renowned Byzantine Hagia Sophia boasts unique Christian mosaics and lofty 6th-century domes.
                    <br><br>Istanbul is a rare and special location in Turkey since it shares borders with eight countries: Bulgaria in the northwest, Greece in the west, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan in the northeast, Iran in the east, and Iraq and
                    Syria in the southeast. It is also bordered on the north by the Black Sea, the west by the Aegean Sea, and the south by the Mediterranean Sea. Turkey also has the Sea of Marmara, which geographers use to demarcate the border between
                    Europe and Asia, making Turkey a transcontinental country.Istanbul also is a city in Turkey. It was one of the most sought cities in the world for many years.
                    <br><br>In 2010, the city was named one of the European Capitals of Culture. In 1985, the historic districts of Istanbul were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The capital was shifted to Ankara in 1923 after the Republic
                    of Turkey was established. Istanbul is Europe's second largest city, with a population of 8,803,468 inhabitants in the city and 10,018,735 in the metropolitan area, according to the 2000 census. Istanbul is one of the twenty largest
                    metropolitan areas in the world, with an estimated population of 11,322,000 people as of July 20, 2005. In 2010, the city was named the European Capital of Culture.</p>

                    <div class="main-container">
                        <p>John Freely in his book Istanbul: The Imperial City (1998) notes, the city was originally known as Byzantium. Istanbul was a thousand years old when Constantine the Great made it the capital of the Roman Empire in 330 AD. Since
                            then, Istanbul has been named Constantinople or the city of Constantine. Constantine the Great even referred to the city as New Rome. Constantinople then grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Europe
                            <br><br>Launching Britannica, the reign of Justinian (527-565 AD) was the peak of Constantinople's glory. Therefore, the population at the beginning of his reign was around 500,000 people. However, a great fire engulfed the
                            city in 532 AD and many rebellions resulted in the death of its inhabitants in large numbers. The rebuilding of Constantinople gave Justinian the opportunity to be directly involved in this magnificent project whose legacy
                            can still be seen today. During this time, the Hagia Sophia was built with stunning architecture. Hagia Sophia or Aya Sofya is a place of worship in Istanbul which was built in 537 AD to 1453 AD. This building is an Orthodox
                            Cathedral.
                            <br><br>In 542 AD, the city of Constantinople was hit by a plague that is said to have killed three out of every five inhabitants. Not only Constantinople, but the Roman Empire in general were also affected with a very slow
                            recovery process until the 9th century. During this period, the city was attacked by Persians and Avars (626 AD), Arabs (674-678 AD and 717-718 AD), Bulgars (813 AD and 913 AD), Russians (860 AD, 941 AD, and 1043 AD ), and
                            the Pechenegs (1090-1091 AD). However, all failed to conquer Constantinople. In the centuries that followed, the city became a silent witness to political struggles and power struggles from various parties until it was finally
                            controlled by the Ottoman Turks</p>

                    <div class="main-container">
                        <p>The first attempt by the Ottoman Turks to take control of Constantinople took place in 1422 AD by Sultan Murad II, but the attempt failed. Thirty years later, Sultan Mehmed II continued that effort by blockading the Bosphorus Strait
                            beginning in April 1453 CE. The final attack was carried out on May 29, 1453 and killed the last Byzantine leader Constantine XI. Mehmed II then removed the population from other conquered areas, such as the Peloponnese, Salonika,
                            and the Greek islands. Around AD 1480, Istanbul's population increased to between 60,000 and 70,000 people.
                            <br><br>Hagia Sophia and other Byzantine churches were converted into mosques. However, the Greek Patriarchate was retained, but was transferred to the Pammakaristos Church, then moved to the Fener area. After Mehmed II, Istanbul
                            experienced a long period of peaceful growth, only interrupted by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, and plagues. The brightest period of Ottoman construction coincided with the reign of Suleyman (1520-1566 AD).
                            The next major change in Istanbul's history took place in the early 19th century, when the Ottoman Empire was nearing its demise. This period is known as the era of internal reform (Tanzimat) which was accompanied by a number
                            of serious disturbances. In the time of Sultan Mahmud II, the westernization of Istanbul began very quickly. This was marked by an ever-increasing flow of European visitors since the 1830s. In 1839, Sultan Abdulmecid I issued
                            a charter guaranteeing all his subjects, regardless of religion, security of life and wealth. The late 19th and early 20th centuries were marked by the introduction of various public services, such as the railroad in the early
                            1870s.

                        <h3><b>Era Modern of Istanbul</b></h3>
                        <p>The first quarter of the twentieth century saw various disturbances that marked the fall of the Ottoman era and the birth of modern Turkey. Throughout World War I, the city was under blockade. After the end of the Armistice (1918),
                            Istanbul was under British, French and Italian occupation which lasted until 1923. With the victory of the Nationalists under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the Ottoman sultanate was abolished. Its last sultan, Mehmed VI fled Istanbul.
                            On October 29, 1923 the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed. After World War II, Istanbul's population increased dramatically due to the migration of villagers to the city in search of work.</p>
